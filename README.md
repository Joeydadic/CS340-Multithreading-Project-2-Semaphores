# CS340-Multithreading-Project-2-Semaphores
This project was done for my CS 340 Operating Systems Principles course at CUNY Queens College. Dr. Simina Fluture gave us an arbitrary scenario in which each student individually was required to implement using Multithreading in Java with the usage of Semaphores.
